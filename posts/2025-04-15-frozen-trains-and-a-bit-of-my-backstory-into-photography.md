# Frozen Trains and a bit of my backstory into photography

As a photographer, I have always been drawn to unique and unexpected subjects. One day, while exploring an abandoned train yard, I stumbled upon a row of frozen trains, covered in a thick layer of ice and snow. The sight was both eerie and captivating, and I knew I had to capture it through my lens.

## My Backstory into Photography

My journey into photography began at a young age, when I received my first camera as a gift. I was instantly hooked, and spent countless hours capturing the world around me. As I grew older, my passion for photography only deepened, and I began experimenting with different styles and techniques.

I found that I was particularly drawn to urban exploration photography, which involves documenting abandoned and decaying spaces. There is something hauntingly beautiful about these forgotten places, and I love the challenge of capturing their essence through my photographs.

## Practical Tips for Photographing Frozen Trains

### 1. Dress warmly
When photographing frozen trains, it is important to dress warmly, as you may be spending hours outside in cold temperatures. Make sure to wear layers, gloves, and a hat to keep yourself comfortable while you work.

### 2. Use a tripod
To capture sharp, detailed images of the frozen trains, it is essential to use a tripod. This will help stabilize your camera and prevent any blur or shake in your photos.

### 3. Experiment with angles
Don't be afraid to get creative with your composition when photographing the frozen trains. Try shooting from different angles and perspectives to find the most interesting and visually appealing shots.

### 4. Capture the details
Don't forget to zoom in and capture the intricate details of the frozen trains, such as the ice formations and rusted metal. These small elements can add depth and interest to your images.

### 5. Play with light
Experiment with different lighting conditions when photographing the frozen trains. Early morning or late afternoon light can create dramatic shadows and highlights, adding a dynamic element to your photos.
