# 5 Frames with a Nikon FE

Are you a photographer looking to experiment with film photography? The Nikon FE is a great camera to start with. This classic 35mm film camera was popular in the 1970s and 1980s and is still cherished by photographers today for its reliability and versatility. In this blog post, we will explore how to make the most out of your Nikon FE by shooting 5 frames with it.

## Introduction

The Nikon FE is a manual focus SLR camera that offers full manual control over exposure settings. It has a light meter that helps you set the correct exposure, making it an excellent camera for beginners and experienced photographers alike. With its sturdy build and compact size, the Nikon FE is a great camera to take on the go and capture stunning images.

## Practical Tips for Shooting with a Nikon FE

1. **Use a Fast Film**: The Nikon FE performs best with fast film, such as ISO 400 or higher. This will allow you to shoot in a variety of lighting conditions without worrying about underexposure.

2. **Experiment with Different Lenses**: The Nikon FE is compatible with a wide range of Nikon F-mount lenses. Try using different lenses to achieve different effects in your photos, such as a wide-angle lens for landscapes or a telephoto lens for portraits.

3. **Master Manual Exposure**: The Nikon FE's manual exposure control allows you to have full control over your images. Take the time to learn how to set the correct aperture and shutter speed for each shot to achieve the desired effect.

4. **Focus on Composition**: Like any other camera, the Nikon FE benefits from good composition. Pay attention to the rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing to create visually appealing images.

5. **Embrace the Grain**: Shooting with film gives your photos a unique look with a natural grain. Embrace the grain and use it to add character to your images.
