# Building a Camera Rig in Pursuit of the Kodak Aerochrome Look

In the world of photography, there are certain looks and styles that capture the imagination of photographers everywhere. One such look is the Kodak Aerochrome look, known for its vibrant, otherworldly colors that seem to transcend reality. Originally designed for military reconnaissance purposes, the Aerochrome film has since become a favorite among photographers looking to add a unique and surreal touch to their images.

Achieving the Kodak Aerochrome look can be a challenge, as the film itself has been discontinued and is difficult to come by. However, with a bit of creativity and some DIY spirit, it is possible to replicate this look using a custom camera rig. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a camera rig that can help you achieve the Kodak Aerochrome look in your own photography.

## Introduction

The Kodak Aerochrome film was known for its ability to capture infrared light, resulting in stunning images with vibrant pink and purple hues. While the film itself is no longer in production, many photographers have attempted to recreate the look using digital cameras and various filters.

One popular method for achieving the Aerochrome look is by using a modified camera rig that allows you to capture infrared light. By removing the camera's infrared filter and adding a visible light filter, you can create images that closely resemble the look of the Aerochrome film.

## Practical Tips

### 1. Choose the Right Camera

When building a camera rig for the Kodak Aerochrome look, it is important to choose the right camera. Look for a camera that can be easily modified, such as a mirrorless camera or a DSLR with a removable filter. This will make it easier to remove the infrared filter and add a visible light filter.

### 2. Remove the Infrared Filter

The first step in building a camera rig for the Kodak Aerochrome look is to remove the camera's infrared filter. This filter is typically located in front of the camera's sensor and blocks out infrared light. By removing this filter, you can allow infrared light to reach the sensor and capture the unique colors associated with the Aerochrome look.

### 3. Add a Visible Light Filter

Once you have removed the infrared filter, you will need to add a visible light filter to your camera rig. This filter will block out visible light and only allow infrared light to pass through, creating the distinctive pink and purple hues of the Aerochrome look.

### 4. Experiment with Different Filters

To achieve the perfect Aerochrome look, don't be afraid to experiment with different filters and settings. Try using different types of visible light filters to see how they affect the colors in your images. You can also adjust the white balance and exposure settings to fine-tune the look of your photos.

### 5. Practice, Practice, Practice

Building a camera rig for the Kodak Aerochrome look takes time and practice. Don't be discouraged if your first few attempts don't turn out exactly as you had hoped. Keep experimenting and refining your technique until you achieve the look you desire.
