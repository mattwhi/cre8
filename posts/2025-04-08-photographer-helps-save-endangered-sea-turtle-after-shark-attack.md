## The Incident

The photographer, who wishes to remain anonymous, was on a remote beach capturing images of the sunrise when they noticed a commotion in the water. As they got closer, they realized that a shark was attacking a sea turtle. Without hesitation, the photographer waded into the water to try and scare off the shark.

With no time to waste, they carefully lifted the turtle out of the water and brought it to shore. Using basic first aid skills, the photographer cleaned and bandaged the turtle's wounds as best as they could. They then made the decision to transport the turtle to a nearby marine rehabilitation center for further treatment.
