# Street Photography Inspired by Geometry in Berlin

Berlin is a city known for its eclectic mix of architecture, from historic buildings to modern skyscrapers. The streets of Berlin are filled with geometric shapes and patterns that can provide endless inspiration for photographers. In this blog post, we will explore how you can use these geometric elements to create stunning street photography in the vibrant city of Berlin.

## Introduction

Street photography is a popular genre that captures the essence of everyday life in urban environments. It is all about capturing candid moments and telling a story through your images. One way to add an interesting twist to your street photography is to focus on the geometric shapes and patterns that can be found in the cityscape.

Berlin is a city with a rich history and a diverse architectural landscape. From the iconic Brandenburg Gate to the modernist buildings of Potsdamer Platz, there is no shortage of interesting subjects to photograph. By incorporating geometric shapes into your compositions, you can create visually striking images that stand out from the crowd.

## Practical Tips

Here are some practical tips for incorporating geometry into your street photography in Berlin:

### 1. Look for Leading Lines

Leading lines are a powerful compositional tool that can help guide the viewer's eye through your image. In Berlin, you can find leading lines in the form of roads, railways, and buildings. Look for opportunities to use these lines to create a sense of depth and perspective in your photos.

### 2. Experiment with Symmetry

Symmetry can create a sense of balance and harmony in your images. Look for symmetrical patterns in the architecture of Berlin's buildings and use them to create visually appealing compositions. You can also experiment with reflections to add an extra layer of interest to your photos.

### 3. Play with Shadows

Shadows can add drama and dimension to your street photography. In Berlin, you can find interesting shadow patterns created by the city's unique architecture. Look for opportunities to capture these shadows in your images and use them to create dynamic compositions.

### 4. Use Geometric Shapes

Geometric shapes, such as circles, squares, and triangles, can add visual interest to your street photography. Look for these shapes in the architecture of Berlin's buildings and use them to frame your subjects or create patterns within your compositions.

### 5. Experiment with Different Perspectives

Don't be afraid to get down low or climb up high to find unique perspectives for your street photography. By changing your vantage point, you can create images that stand out from the typical tourist snapshots. Experiment with different angles and viewpoints to see what works best for the scene you are photographing.
