### 3. Play with Angles

Experimenting with different angles can help you create dynamic and visually interesting portraits. Try shooting from below to emphasize the strength and power of your subject, or shoot from above for a more intimate and vulnerable look. Don't be afraid to get creative with your composition and framing.
