# Gelatin Labs’s ‘GelForm’ Styles Makes Film Scanning Smarter (and Faster)

In the world of photography, film scanning is a crucial step in the digitization process. It allows photographers to preserve and share their film images in a digital format. However, traditional film scanning methods can be time-consuming and tedious. That's where GelForm styles from Gelatin Labs come in. These innovative styles are designed to make film scanning smarter and faster, saving photographers valuable time and energy.

## Introduction to GelForm Styles

GelForm styles are a set of pre-defined settings that can be applied to film scans during the digitization process. These styles are specifically tailored to enhance the quality of film scans, making them sharper, more vibrant, and true to the original film image. With GelForm styles, photographers can achieve professional-looking results with just a few clicks, eliminating the need for manual adjustments and corrections.

## The Benefits of GelForm Styles

One of the main advantages of using GelForm styles is the time-saving aspect. Instead of spending hours tweaking and fine-tuning each individual film scan, photographers can simply apply a GelForm style and achieve consistent, high-quality results in a fraction of the time. This allows photographers to focus more on their creative process and less on technical issues.

Another benefit of GelForm styles is their versatility. Whether you're scanning color negative, black and white, or slide film, there's a GelForm style that's perfect for your needs. These styles are designed to work seamlessly with a wide range of film types, ensuring that your scans look their best no matter what type of film you're using.

## Practical Tips for Using GelForm Styles

To get the most out of GelForm styles, here are some practical tips to keep in mind:

1. **Experiment with Different Styles**: Don't be afraid to try out different GelForm styles to see which one works best for your film scans. Each style has its own unique characteristics, so it's worth experimenting to find the perfect match for your images.

2. **Fine-Tune as Needed**: While GelForm styles are designed to be a one-click solution, you may still need to make some minor adjustments to achieve the desired look. Don't be afraid to tweak the settings to suit your personal preferences.

3. **Backup Your Original Scans**: Before applying a GelForm style to your film scans, make sure to create a backup of the original files. This way, you can always go back to the original scan if needed.

## Conclusion

Gelatin Labs’s GelForm styles are a game-changer for photographers who want to streamline their film scanning workflow.
