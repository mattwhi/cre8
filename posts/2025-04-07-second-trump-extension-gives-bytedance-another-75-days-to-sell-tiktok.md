# Second Trump Extension Gives ByteDance Another 75 Days to Sell TikTok

In the ever-evolving landscape of social media, one platform has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons - TikTok. The popular video-sharing app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of a political storm in the United States, with President Donald Trump threatening to ban the app over national security concerns. 

However, in a recent development, President Trump has granted ByteDance a second 75-day extension to sell TikTok's US operations, giving the company more time to find a buyer and avoid a potential ban. This decision has sparked a mix of relief and uncertainty among TikTok users and creators, especially those in the photography community.

As photographers who rely on social media platforms to showcase our work and connect with our audience, the potential ban of TikTok could have significant implications for our careers. In this blog post, we will explore the latest developments surrounding the TikTok saga and provide practical tips for photographers on how to navigate this uncertain landscape.

## The TikTok Saga Continues

Since its launch in 2016, TikTok has quickly become one of the most popular social media platforms, with over 800 million active users worldwide. The app allows users to create short, engaging videos set to music, making it a favorite among Gen Z and millennial users. However, TikTok's Chinese ownership has raised concerns among US lawmakers, who fear that the app could be used to collect sensitive user data and pose a national security risk.

In response to these concerns, President Trump issued an executive order in August 2020, giving ByteDance 90 days to divest its US operations or face a ban. This deadline was later extended to November 12, 2020, as ByteDance sought to finalize a deal with potential buyers, including Oracle and Walmart. However, with the deadline looming, President Trump granted ByteDance a second 75-day extension, pushing the deadline to March 22, 2021.

## Practical Tips for Photographers

As photographers, social media platforms like TikTok play a crucial role in our marketing and branding efforts. The potential ban of TikTok could disrupt our ability to reach new audiences and engage with our followers. To navigate this uncertain landscape, here are some practical tips for photographers:

1. **Diversify Your Social Media Presence**: While TikTok has been a valuable platform for reaching a younger audience, it's essential to diversify your social media presence to mitigate the impact of a potential ban. Consider focusing on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube to continue sharing your work and connecting with your audience.

2. **Engage with Your Audience**: Building a strong connection with your audience is key to maintaining your online presence. Take the time to engage with your followers through comments, likes, and direct messages. Consider hosting live Q&A sessions or behind-the-scenes videos to keep your audience engaged and invested in your work.

3. **Create Engaging Content**: In the age of short attention spans, creating engaging and visually appealing content is crucial to capturing your audience's attention. Experiment with different formats, such as reels, stories, and IGTV videos, to showcase your photography in a creative and engaging way.

4. **Stay Informed**: Keep yourself informed about the latest developments surrounding TikTok and the potential ban. Follow news sources and industry experts to stay up-to-date on any changes that may impact your online presence. Stay flexible and be prepared to adapt your social media strategy as needed.
