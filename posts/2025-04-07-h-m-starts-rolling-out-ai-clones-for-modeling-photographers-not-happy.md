# H&M Starts Rolling Out AI Clones for Modeling, Photographers Not Happy

In a move that has sparked controversy within the fashion photography industry, retail giant H&M has announced that they will be using AI clones for modeling in their upcoming campaigns. This decision has left many photographers feeling sidelined and concerned about the future of their profession. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, it raises questions about the role of human photographers in an increasingly automated world.

## The Impact on Photographers

Photographers have long been an integral part of the fashion industry, bringing their unique creative vision and expertise to create stunning images that capture the essence of a brand. However, with the rise of AI technology, there is growing concern that photographers may soon be replaced by machines. H&M's decision to use AI clones for modeling is just the latest example of this trend, leaving many photographers feeling threatened and undervalued.

## Practical Tips for Photographers

If you're a photographer who is feeling anxious about the rise of AI technology in the industry, here are some practical tips to help you navigate this changing landscape:

1. **Focus on Your Unique Style**: One of the things that sets human photographers apart from AI clones is their individual creativity and style. Focus on developing your own unique aesthetic and vision, and showcase this in your work to stand out from the crowd.

2. **Embrace Technology**: While AI technology may be seen as a threat, it can also be a valuable tool for photographers. Embrace new technologies and learn how to incorporate them into your workflow to enhance your work and stay competitive in the industry.

3. **Build Strong Relationships**: Building strong relationships with clients and brands can help you secure work and stand out from the competition. Cultivate a strong network of contacts and focus on delivering exceptional results to keep clients coming back for more.

4. **Diversify Your Skillset**: In a rapidly changing industry, it's important to diversify your skillset to adapt to new trends and technologies. Consider learning new techniques, such as video production or drone photography, to expand your offerings and appeal to a wider range of clients.

5. **Stay Positive and Adapt**: While the rise of AI technology may be intimidating, it's important to stay positive and adapt to the changing landscape. Embrace new challenges and opportunities, and focus on continually improving your craft to stay relevant in the industry.
