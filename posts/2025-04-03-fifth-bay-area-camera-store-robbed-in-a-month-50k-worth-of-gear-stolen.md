4. **Be Mindful of Your Surroundings:** Always be aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded or unfamiliar areas. Keep your gear close to you and avoid leaving it unattended.

5. **Backup Your Data:** In case your gear is stolen, make sure to regularly back up your photos and videos to prevent losing valuable work.
