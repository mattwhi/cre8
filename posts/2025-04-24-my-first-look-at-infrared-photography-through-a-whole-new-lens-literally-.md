# My first look at infrared photography through a whole new lens (Literally!)

As a photographer, I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and push the boundaries of my creativity. Recently, I decided to explore the world of infrared photography, a technique that captures light not visible to the human eye. The results have been truly stunning and have opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me as a visual artist.

## Introduction to Infrared Photography

Infrared photography involves using a special camera or modifying a traditional camera to capture light in the infrared spectrum. This results in images with a dreamy, surreal quality that is unlike anything you can achieve with traditional photography. The colors are shifted, foliage appears bright white, and skies can take on a dramatic, otherworldly appearance.

## Practical Tips for Infrared Photography

1. **Invest in the Right Equipment**: To get started with infrared photography, you will need a camera that is capable of capturing infrared light. Some cameras have a built-in infrared filter, while others may require a separate filter to be attached to the lens. Do your research and choose the equipment that best suits your needs and budget.

2. **Experiment with Different Filters**: There are a variety of infrared filters available, each with its own unique properties. Some filters block out all visible light, while others allow a small amount to pass through. Experimenting with different filters can help you achieve the look you desire in your infrared images.

3. **Choose the Right Subjects**: Certain subjects lend themselves well to infrared photography, such as landscapes, architecture, and portraits. Experiment with different scenes to see how they are transformed by the infrared spectrum.

4. **Play with Post-Processing**: Infrared images often require some post-processing to achieve the desired look. Experiment with adjusting the white balance, contrast, and saturation to enhance the surreal quality of your images.

5. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Like any new technique, infrared photography takes time and practice to master. Don't be discouraged if your first attempts don't turn out exactly as you had hoped. Keep experimenting and learning from your mistakes.

## Conclusion

Infrared photography has opened up a whole new world of creative possibilities for me as a photographer. The dreamy, surreal quality of infrared images is unlike anything I have experienced before, and I am excited to continue exploring this unique technique. By investing in the right equipment, experimenting with different filters, choosing the right subjects, playing with post-processing, and practicing regularly, I have been able to capture stunning infrared images that have truly expanded my artistic horizons. I encourage any photographer looking to challenge themselves and push the boundaries of their creativity to give infrared photography a try. Who knows, you may just discover a whole new world of visual possibilities through a whole new lens!
