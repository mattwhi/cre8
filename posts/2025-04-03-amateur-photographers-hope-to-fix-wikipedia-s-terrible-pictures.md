# Amateur photographers hope to fix Wikipedia's 'terrible' pictures

Have you ever found yourself browsing through Wikipedia pages only to be disappointed by the poor quality of the images? Many amateur photographers have noticed this issue and are taking matters into their own hands. With the rise of smartphone photography and affordable DSLR cameras, more and more people are trying their hand at photography. And what better way to practice and showcase their skills than by contributing to the world's largest online encyclopedia?

## Introduction

Wikipedia is a valuable resource for information on a wide range of topics, but the quality of its images often leaves much to be desired. Many of the photos on Wikipedia are outdated, low resolution, or simply not very visually appealing. This is where amateur photographers come in. By contributing their own high-quality images to Wikipedia, they can help improve the overall user experience and make the site more visually engaging.

## Practical Tips

If you're an amateur photographer looking to make a difference on Wikipedia, here are some practical tips to help you get started:

1. **Choose your subjects wisely**: Before you start snapping away, take some time to research which Wikipedia pages could benefit from new images. Look for articles that are lacking in visuals or have outdated photos.

2. **Focus on high-quality images**: Make sure your photos are well-lit, in focus, and composed well. Remember, Wikipedia is a platform for educational purposes, so clarity and accuracy are key.

3. **Follow Wikipedia's image guidelines**: Before uploading your images, familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's image guidelines. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and provide accurate descriptions and categories for your photos.

4. **Contribute to Wiki Loves Monuments**: One great way to get involved in improving Wikipedia's image quality is by participating in Wiki Loves Monuments, an annual photography contest that aims to document the world's cultural heritage. This is a fantastic opportunity to showcase your photography skills and contribute to a worthy cause.

5. **Collaborate with other photographers**: Consider joining a local photography group or online community dedicated to improving Wikipedia's image quality. By collaborating with other photographers, you can learn from one another and work together to make a greater impact.
