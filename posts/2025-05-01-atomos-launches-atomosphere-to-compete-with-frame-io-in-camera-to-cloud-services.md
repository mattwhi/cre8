# ATOMOS Launches AtomoSphere to Compete with Frame.io in Camera-to-Cloud Services

In the ever-evolving world of photography and videography, staying ahead of the curve is essential. Recently, **ATOMOS** has made waves with the launch of **AtomoSphere**, their new camera-to-cloud service aimed at competing with the likes of **Frame.io**. This new platform promises to revolutionize the way photographers and videographers work by providing seamless integration between cameras and the cloud.
