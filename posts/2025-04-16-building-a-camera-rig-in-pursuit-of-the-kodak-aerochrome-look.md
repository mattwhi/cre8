# Building a Camera Rig in Pursuit of the Kodak Aerochrome Look

In the world of photography, there are certain looks and styles that capture the imagination of photographers and enthusiasts alike. One such look is the unique and vibrant color palette of Kodak Aerochrome film. Originally used for aerial photography, the film has gained a cult following for its surreal and otherworldly hues. In this blog post, we will explore how you can build a camera rig to emulate the Kodak Aerochrome look in your own photography.

## Introduction

Kodak Aerochrome film was originally developed for military reconnaissance purposes, but its striking colors and surreal aesthetic have made it a favorite among photographers looking to add a unique twist to their images. The film is known for its vibrant reds, purples, and greens, which can give landscapes and portraits a dreamlike quality.

While Kodak Aerochrome film is no longer in production, photographers have found ways to replicate its look using digital cameras and editing techniques. One popular method is to use a modified camera rig that can capture infrared light, which is responsible for the unique colors of Aerochrome film.

## Practical Tips

### 1. Choose the Right Camera

To capture the Kodak Aerochrome look, you will need a camera that is capable of capturing infrared light. Some cameras have a built-in infrared filter that blocks out this light, so you will need to either remove or replace this filter. Alternatively, you can use a camera that has been modified specifically for infrared photography.

### 2. Use an Infrared Filter

In addition to modifying your camera, you can also use an infrared filter to enhance the colors in your images. Infrared filters block out visible light and only allow infrared light to pass through, giving your photos a distinct look. Experiment with different types of infrared filters to see which one works best for you.

### 3. Experiment with Post-Processing

Once you have captured your images, you can further enhance the Kodak Aerochrome look through post-processing techniques. Adjusting the white balance, saturation, and color channels can help bring out the vibrant colors that are characteristic of Aerochrome film. Experiment with different editing styles to find the look that best suits your vision.

### 4. Practice Patience and Persistence

Achieving the Kodak Aerochrome look can take time and practice, so don't get discouraged if your first attempts don't turn out as expected. Keep experimenting with different camera settings, filters, and editing techniques until you find the combination that works best for you. Remember, photography is a journey, and each image you create is a step towards honing your craft.
