# Young Owls in Calgary at Risk of 'Unethical' Photography Practices - CBC

In a recent article by CBC, it was brought to light that young owls in Calgary are at risk of being subjected to unethical photography practices. The article highlights the growing concern among wildlife photographers and conservationists about the impact of intrusive photography on these vulnerable birds.

As photographers, it is important for us to be mindful of our actions and the potential harm they can cause to the wildlife we are trying to capture. In this blog post, we will discuss the issue at hand, provide practical tips for ethical wildlife photography, and emphasize the importance of respecting the boundaries of these magnificent creatures.

## The Issue at Hand

The article by CBC sheds light on the increasing number of photographers who are venturing into the natural habitats of young owls in Calgary in search of the perfect shot. Unfortunately, this has led to a rise in unethical practices such as getting too close to the birds, disturbing their nests, and even baiting them with food to get a better photo.

This kind of behavior not only disrupts the natural behavior of the owls but can also have long-term negative effects on their health and well-being. It is crucial for us as photographers to remember that our actions can have a direct impact on the wildlife we are photographing.

## Practical Tips for Ethical Wildlife Photography

### 1. **Keep Your Distance**
   When photographing wildlife, it is important to maintain a safe distance from the animals to avoid causing stress or disturbance. Use a telephoto lens to capture close-up shots without intruding on their space.

### 2. **Respect Their Environment**
   Avoid trampling on vegetation or disturbing nests and habitats. Be mindful of the impact your presence may have on the natural surroundings and take care to leave no trace behind.

### 3. **Avoid Baiting**
   Do not bait animals with food or other attractants to get a better shot. This can disrupt their natural behavior and create dependencies that are harmful to their survival.

### 4. **Be Patient**
   Wildlife photography requires patience and dedication. Allow the animals to behave naturally and capture candid moments without interfering in their daily routines.

### 5. **Educate Others**
   Spread awareness about the importance of ethical wildlife photography and encourage others to follow suit. By setting a positive example, we can help protect the wildlife we love to photograph.
