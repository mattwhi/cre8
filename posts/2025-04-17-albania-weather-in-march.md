3. **Explore the Countryside**: Albania's countryside is dotted with quaint villages, rolling hills, and ancient ruins. March is an excellent time to explore these hidden gems before the summer crowds arrive.

4. **Attend Cultural Events**: March is a month of celebration in Albania, with various festivals and events taking place throughout the country. These events provide fantastic opportunities to capture the local culture and traditions.
