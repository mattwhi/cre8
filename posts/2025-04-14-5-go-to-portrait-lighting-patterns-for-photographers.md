# 5 Go-To Portrait Lighting Patterns for Photographers

As a photographer, understanding different lighting patterns is essential for creating stunning portraits. Knowing how to manipulate light can help you emphasize certain features, create mood, and add depth to your images. In this blog post, we will explore five go-to portrait lighting patterns that every photographer should master.

## Introduction to Portrait Lighting

Lighting is one of the most important elements in photography, especially when it comes to portraiture. The way light falls on your subject can drastically change the mood and feel of an image. By mastering different lighting patterns, you can achieve a wide range of effects in your portraits.

## 1. Rembrandt Lighting

Rembrandt lighting is a classic portrait lighting pattern named after the famous Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn. This lighting pattern is characterized by a small triangle of light on the cheek of the subject on the opposite side of the key light. To achieve Rembrandt lighting, place your key light at a 45-degree angle to the side of your subject and slightly above eye level. This will create a beautiful, dramatic effect that adds depth and dimension to your portraits.

## 2. Loop Lighting

Loop lighting is another popular portrait lighting pattern that is flattering for most subjects. To achieve loop lighting, place your key light slightly to the side of your subject and above eye level. The light should create a small loop-shaped shadow on the opposite side of the nose. This lighting pattern is great for adding soft, flattering light to your portraits and works well for a variety of subjects.

## 3. Butterfly Lighting

Butterfly lighting, also known as paramount lighting, is a classic portrait lighting pattern that creates a distinctive butterfly-shaped shadow under the subject's nose. To achieve butterfly lighting, place your key light directly in front of your subject and slightly above eye level. This lighting pattern is often used in fashion photography and creates a glamorous, high-fashion look.

## 4. Split Lighting

Split lighting is a dramatic portrait lighting pattern that involves splitting the subject's face into equal halves, with one side in shadow and the other in light. To achieve split lighting, place your key light at a 90-degree angle to the side of your subject. This will create a striking, bold look that is perfect for adding mood and intensity to your portraits.

## 5. Broad Lighting

Broad lighting is a versatile portrait lighting pattern that involves illuminating the side of the subject's face that is facing the camera. This creates a broad area of light on the subject's face and can help to soften features and create a flattering look. To achieve broad lighting, place your key light at a 45-degree angle to the side of your subject that is facing the camera. This lighting pattern works well for a variety of subjects and can help to create a natural, flattering look.

## Conclusion

Mastering different portrait lighting patterns is essential for creating stunning portraits. By understanding how to manipulate light, you can add depth, mood, and dimension to your images. Whether you prefer soft, flattering light or bold, dramatic shadows, there is a portrait lighting pattern for every style and subject. Experiment with these five go-to lighting patterns and discover new ways to enhance your portraits.
