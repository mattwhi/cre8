In this blog post, we will explore the weather conditions in Albania during March and provide practical tips for photographers looking to make the most of this picturesque time of year.

## Introduction to Albania Weather in March

Albania experiences a Mediterranean climate, which means that March can be a mix of cool, rainy days and warm, sunny days. The average temperature in Albania in March ranges from 10°C to 15°C, with highs reaching up to 20°C on warmer days. However, it's important to note that temperatures can vary depending on the region of the country, with coastal areas typically being warmer than inland regions.

Rainfall is also common in March, with an average of 10-12 rainy days throughout the month. While this may seem like a lot, the rain typically comes in short bursts and is often followed by clear skies and sunshine. This can create stunning opportunities for photographers to capture rainbows, dramatic cloud formations, and vibrant colors in the landscape.
