# Nikon's New 135mm f/1.8: Worth the Premium?

When it comes to capturing stunning portraits, having the right lens can make all the difference. Nikon recently released their new 135mm f/1.8 lens, promising exceptional image quality and creamy bokeh. But with a premium price tag, is it worth the investment for photographers? In this blog post, we'll dive into the features of the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens, provide practical tips for using it effectively, and ultimately answer the question: is it worth the premium?

## Features of the Nikon 135mm f/1.8

The Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens is designed for portrait photographers who want to achieve a shallow depth of field and beautiful background blur. With a fast maximum aperture of f/1.8, this lens excels in low-light situations and allows for creative control over depth of field. The 135mm focal length provides a flattering perspective for portraits, making it a popular choice among professionals.

One of the key features of the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens is its optical construction. With 9 elements in 7 groups, including Extra-Low Dispersion (ED) glass and Nano Crystal Coat, this lens delivers sharp, high-contrast images with minimal chromatic aberration and flare. The bokeh produced by this lens is smooth and creamy, thanks to its 9-blade rounded diaphragm.

In terms of build quality, the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens is constructed with a durable metal barrel and weather-sealed design, making it suitable for use in various shooting conditions. The lens features a silent Wave Motor (SWM) for fast and quiet autofocus, as well as a manual focus override for fine-tuning focus when needed.

## Practical Tips for Using the Nikon 135mm f/1.8

When shooting with the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens, there are a few practical tips to keep in mind to make the most of its capabilities:

1. **Use a wide aperture for creamy bokeh:** The f/1.8 maximum aperture of this lens allows you to achieve a shallow depth of field and beautiful background blur. Experiment with different aperture settings to control the amount of bokeh in your images.

2. **Focus on the eyes:** When shooting portraits with a telephoto lens like the 135mm, it's important to focus on the subject's eyes to create a connection with the viewer. Use the lens's fast autofocus and manual focus override to ensure sharp eye details.

3. **Consider composition:** The 135mm focal length provides a flattering perspective for portraits, but it can also compress the background, making it appear closer to the subject. Use this to your advantage by carefully composing your shots to isolate the subject and create a sense of depth.

4. **Shoot in RAW:** To take full advantage of the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens's optical quality, shoot in RAW format and post-process your images to enhance sharpness, contrast, and color accuracy.

## Is the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 Worth the Premium?

After exploring the features of the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens and learning some practical tips for using it effectively, the question remains: is it worth the premium price tag? Ultimately, the answer depends on your individual needs and budget.

If you're a professional portrait photographer who values exceptional image quality, creamy bokeh, and reliable performance, the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens may be worth the investment. Its fast maximum aperture, sharp optics, and durable build make it a versatile tool for capturing stunning portraits in a variety of conditions.

However, if you're a hobbyist photographer or on a tight budget, there are other lens options available that can still produce excellent results at a lower cost. Consider renting the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens for a specific shoot to see if it aligns with your shooting style and preferences before making a purchase.

In conclusion, the Nikon 135mm f/1.8 lens offers professional photographers a premium option for capturing stunning portraits with exceptional image quality and bokeh. With careful consideration of your needs and budget, you can determine whether this lens is worth the investment for your photography kit.
