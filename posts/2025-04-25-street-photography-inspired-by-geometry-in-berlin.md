# Street Photography Inspired by Geometry in Berlin

Berlin is a city known for its vibrant street art, eclectic architecture, and rich history. For photographers, the city offers a wealth of opportunities to capture stunning images that showcase the unique blend of old and new, traditional and modern. One of the most fascinating aspects of Berlin's visual landscape is the prevalence of geometric shapes and patterns that can be found throughout the city. From the sharp angles of Bauhaus buildings to the intricate designs of street art murals, Berlin is a playground for photographers who are inspired by geometry.

In this blog post, we will explore how you can use the principles of geometry to create striking street photography in Berlin. We will provide practical tips for capturing geometric shapes and patterns in your images, as well as share some of our favorite spots in the city where you can find inspiration.

## Practical Tips for Capturing Geometry in Street Photography

1. **Look for Lines and Angles**: One of the key elements of geometric photography is the use of lines and angles to create visually dynamic compositions. Look for buildings, bridges, and other architectural elements that feature strong lines and sharp angles. Experiment with different perspectives to find the most interesting compositions.

2. **Use Shadows and Reflections**: Shadows and reflections can add an extra dimension to your geometric photos. Look for opportunities to capture interesting shadow patterns cast by buildings or objects, or use reflective surfaces like glass or water to create unique compositions.

3. **Focus on Patterns**: Patterns can be found everywhere in the urban landscape, from the facades of buildings to the graffiti on walls. Look for repeated shapes and motifs that create a sense of rhythm and harmony in your photos. Experiment with different angles and compositions to highlight the patterns in an engaging way.

4. **Experiment with Symmetry**: Symmetry is a powerful tool in photography that can create a sense of balance and order in your images. Look for symmetrical elements in the environment, such as mirrored buildings or perfectly aligned objects. Experiment with different compositions to create visually striking images.

5. **Play with Color and Contrast**: In geometric photography, color and contrast can help to emphasize the shapes and patterns in your images. Look for bold, contrasting colors that pop against a neutral background, or experiment with black and white photography to highlight the graphic nature of geometric shapes.
