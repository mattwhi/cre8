# 23andMe Users Struggle to Delete Their Highly Sensitive Data

In a world where privacy concerns are at an all-time high, many people are becoming increasingly cautious about the data they share online. This is especially true for users of DNA testing services like 23andMe, who are not only providing personal information but also genetic data that can be extremely sensitive.

Despite the promises of privacy and security from companies like 23andMe, recent reports have shown that many users are struggling to delete their data from these platforms. This has raised concerns among photographers and other professionals who value their privacy and want to protect their personal information.

## The Challenge of Deleting Data from 23andMe

Deleting your data from a platform like 23andMe is not as simple as clicking a button and watching it disappear. Many users have reported difficulties in finding the option to delete their data, and even when they do, the process can be long and complicated.

One of the main reasons for this challenge is that genetic data is not easily reversible. Once you have shared your DNA with a company like 23andMe, it can be difficult to completely erase that information from their databases. This has led to concerns about the security and privacy of this data, especially in light of recent data breaches and hacks.
