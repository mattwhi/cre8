# Center Parcs removes X account from website after fake account set up

**Introduction**

In the world of photography, having your work featured on a popular website can be a huge boost for your career. However, what happens when someone creates a fake account in your name and starts posting photos that aren't yours? This was the dilemma faced by one photographer recently when Center Parcs discovered a fake account using their name and work on their website. In response, Center Parcs promptly removed the account and took steps to prevent this from happening again.

**The Issue**

The photographer, whose name we will refer to as X for privacy reasons, was shocked to discover that someone had created an account using their name and work on the Center Parcs website. The fake account was posting images that were not the original work of X, leading to confusion among followers and potential clients.

**Practical Tips**

1. **Monitor Your Online Presence**: It's essential to regularly check for any unauthorized use of your name or work online. Setting up Google alerts for your name and routinely searching for your work on popular websites can help you stay informed.

2. **Report Fake Accounts**: If you come across a fake account using your name or work, report it to the website or platform immediately. Most websites have processes in place to handle such situations and will take action to remove the account.

3. **Protect Your Work**: Consider watermarking your images or adding a copyright notice to your work to deter others from using it without permission. Additionally, registering your work with the U.S. Copyright Office can provide legal protection in case of infringement.

4. **Stay Vigilant**: Unfortunately, the internet is rife with individuals looking to profit off the work of others. Stay vigilant and proactive in protecting your online presence to avoid falling victim to such scams.

**Conclusion**

The incident involving X and the fake account on the Center Parcs website serves as a reminder of the importance of monitoring your online presence as a photographer. By staying informed, reporting unauthorized use of your work, and taking steps to protect your images, you can safeguard your reputation and prevent others from profiting off your hard work. Remember, in the digital age, it's crucial to stay vigilant and proactive in protecting your creative assets.
