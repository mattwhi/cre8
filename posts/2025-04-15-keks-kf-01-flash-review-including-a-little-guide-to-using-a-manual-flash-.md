## Using a Manual Flash

Using a manual flash like the Keks KF-01 may seem daunting at first, especially for photographers who are used to automatic flash systems. However, with a little practice and experimentation, manual flashes can offer more control and creativity in your photography.

Here are a few tips for using a manual flash effectively:

1. **Adjusting Flash Power**: Manual flashes allow you to adjust the power output of the flash manually. Start by setting the flash power to full power and take a test shot. If the image is overexposed, gradually decrease the power until you achieve the desired exposure.

2. **Setting the Flash Zoom**: Many manual flashes, including the Keks KF-01, allow you to adjust the zoom of the flash head to control the spread of light. For close-up subjects, use a wider zoom setting, and for distant subjects, use a narrower zoom setting.

3. **Experiment with Off-Camera Flash**: One of the advantages of manual flashes is the ability to use them off-camera. Experiment with different lighting angles and positions to create dynamic and interesting lighting effects in your images.

4. **Use Light Modifiers**: To soften the light from your manual flash, consider using light modifiers such as umbrellas, softboxes, or bounce cards. These tools can help create more flattering and natural-looking light in your photos.
