# Fujica 35SE – A second look at a somewhat tatty but unusual camera

When it comes to vintage cameras, there is something truly special about discovering a hidden gem that may not be in the best condition but still has a unique charm. The Fujica 35SE is one such camera that may not be in perfect shape, but it certainly has character and a story to tell. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the Fujica 35SE, explore its features, share some practical tips for using it, and discuss why it is worth giving this somewhat tatty camera a second chance.

## Introduction to the Fujica 35SE

The Fujica 35SE is a 35mm rangefinder camera produced by the Japanese company Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. in the early 1960s. Despite its age, the camera still holds up well in terms of functionality and image quality. The Fujica 35SE features a fixed 45mm f/1.9 lens, a built-in selenium light meter, and a coupled rangefinder for precise focusing. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of modern digital cameras, the Fujica 35SE has a simplicity and elegance that many photographers appreciate.

## Features of the Fujica 35SE

One of the standout features of the Fujica 35SE is its compact and lightweight design, making it easy to carry around for street photography or travel. The camera's fixed lens produces sharp and contrasty images, with a beautiful bokeh effect when used at wider apertures. The built-in light meter is a handy tool for beginners or those who prefer to shoot in manual mode, allowing for accurate exposure settings without the need for an external light meter.

## Practical Tips for Using the Fujica 35SE

If you have recently acquired a Fujica 35SE or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some practical tips to help you get the most out of this unique camera:

1. **Check the Light Meter:** The built-in selenium light meter on the Fujica 35SE may have deteriorated over time, so it is essential to test its accuracy before relying on it for exposure settings. You can do this by comparing its readings with those of a handheld light meter or by using the camera's manual exposure settings.

2. **Experiment with Different Film Stocks:** The Fujica 35SE is compatible with 35mm film, giving you the freedom to experiment with different types of film stocks to achieve various looks and styles in your photographs. Whether you prefer color or black and white film, there are endless possibilities to explore with this camera.

3. **Practice Manual Focusing:** The coupled rangefinder on the Fujica 35SE allows for precise manual focusing, giving you more control over your compositions. Practice using the rangefinder to ensure sharp focus in your images, especially when shooting at wider apertures for a shallow depth of field.

4. **Embrace the Imperfections:** While the Fujica 35SE may not be in perfect condition, its imperfections can add a unique charm to your photographs. Embrace the signs of wear and tear on the camera as part of its history and character, creating a nostalgic and vintage feel in your images.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Fujica 35SE may not be the most pristine camera on the market, but it certainly has a lot to offer in terms of functionality, image quality, and character. Whether you are a seasoned photographer looking to add a vintage camera to your collection or a beginner exploring the world of film photography, the Fujica 35SE is worth considering for its unique features and timeless appeal. Give this somewhat tatty camera a second look, and you may be pleasantly surprised by the results it can produce. Happy shooting!
