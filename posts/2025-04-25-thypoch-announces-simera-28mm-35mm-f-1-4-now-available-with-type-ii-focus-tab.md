With the new Type II focus tab on the Thypoch Simera 28mm and 35mm f/1.4 lenses, photographers can now enjoy a more ergonomic and efficient focusing experience. This blog post will explore the benefits of this new feature and provide practical tips for photographers looking to make the most of these lenses.

## Benefits of the Type II Focus Tab
The Type II focus tab on the Thypoch Simera 28mm and 35mm f/1.4 lenses offers several key benefits for photographers. The tab is larger and more prominent, making it easier to grip and adjust the focus ring quickly and accurately. This is especially useful for photographers working in fast-paced environments or shooting moving subjects.

In addition, the Type II focus tab is designed to be more durable and long-lasting than the previous version. This means that photographers can rely on it to perform consistently over time, even with heavy use. The improved design of the focus tab also adds a touch of elegance to the overall look of the lenses, making them a stylish and practical choice for professionals and enthusiasts alike.

## Practical Tips for Using the Thypoch Simera 28mm & 35mm f/1.4 Lenses
When using the Thypoch Simera 28mm and 35mm f/1.4 lenses with the Type II focus tab, there are a few practical tips that can help photographers get the most out of their equipment.

1. **Practice Adjusting Focus**: Take the time to practice adjusting the focus using the new Type II focus tab before heading out for a shoot. This will help you become familiar with the feel of the tab and ensure that you can make quick and precise adjustments when needed.

2. **Experiment with Different Apertures**: The f/1.4 aperture of these lenses allows for beautiful bokeh and low-light performance. Experiment with different apertures to see how they affect the look of your images and find the settings that work best for your style of photography.

3. **Use Manual Focus for Precision**: While autofocus can be convenient, manual focus gives you greater control over the focusing process. Take advantage of the smooth and responsive focus ring on these lenses to fine-tune your focus and achieve tack-sharp images.
