# Screen Time in Bed Linked to Worse Sleep, Study Finds

In today's digital age, it's not uncommon for many of us to bring our phones, tablets, or laptops to bed with us. Whether it's scrolling through social media, watching a movie, or answering emails, screen time in bed has become a common habit for many. However, a recent study has found that this habit may be negatively impacting our sleep quality.

According to the study published in the *Journal of Sleep Medicine*, researchers found that using electronic devices in bed was associated with worse sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, and increased sleep disturbances. This is due to the blue light emitted from screens, which can disrupt our circadian rhythm and suppress the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep.

## Practical Tips for Photographers

As photographers, we often spend long hours editing photos on our computers or scrolling through images on our phones. However, it's important to be mindful of our screen time, especially in bed, to ensure we're getting the quality sleep we need to stay creative and productive. Here are some practical tips for photographers to reduce screen time in bed and improve their sleep quality:

### 1. Set a Screen Curfew

Try to establish a screen curfew for yourself at least an hour before bedtime. This will give your brain time to wind down and signal to your body that it's time to sleep. Use this time to engage in relaxing activities such as reading a book, meditating, or listening to calming music.

### 2. Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine

Developing a soothing bedtime routine can help you relax and prepare your body for sleep. Consider incorporating activities such as taking a warm bath, practicing gentle yoga, or sipping a cup of herbal tea before bed. This will help signal to your body that it's time to unwind and drift off to sleep.

### 3. Invest in Blue Light Blocking Glasses

If you find it difficult to avoid screens in the evening, consider investing in blue light blocking glasses. These glasses can help reduce the amount of blue light that reaches your eyes, minimizing the disruption to your circadian rhythm and melatonin production. Wear them while editing photos or using electronic devices in bed to protect your sleep quality.

### 4. Keep Electronics Out of the Bedroom

To further reduce the temptation of using electronic devices in bed, consider keeping them out of the bedroom altogether. Create a designated charging station in another room where you can leave your devices overnight. This will help you disconnect from technology and create a more restful sleep environment.

### 5. Practice Good Sleep Hygiene

In addition to reducing screen time in bed, practicing good sleep hygiene is essential for improving your sleep quality. This includes maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime. By prioritizing your sleep health, you'll be better equipped to tackle your photography projects with creativity and focus.

## Conclusion

While it may be tempting to bring our electronic devices to bed with us, the negative impact on our sleep quality is not worth it. By being mindful of our screen time habits and implementing practical tips to reduce screen time in bed, photographers can improve their sleep quality and overall well-being. Prioritize your sleep health to ensure you're well-rested and ready to capture the world through your lens.
