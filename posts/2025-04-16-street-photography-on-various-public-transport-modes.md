# Street Photography on Various Public Transport Modes

Street photography is a unique genre that captures candid moments of everyday life in public spaces. One of the most interesting settings for street photography is public transport. From buses to trains to subways, public transport modes offer a glimpse into the diverse lives of commuters. In this blog post, we will explore how photographers can capture compelling images on various public transport modes.

## Introduction

Public transport is a bustling environment filled with interesting characters, stories, and emotions. As a photographer, it presents an opportunity to document the human experience in a dynamic and ever-changing setting. Whether you're shooting from a bus window or capturing the hustle and bustle of a crowded subway platform, there are endless possibilities for capturing unique and compelling images.

## Practical Tips

### 1. **Blend In**: To capture authentic moments on public transport, it's important to blend in with the crowd. Avoid drawing attention to yourself by using a discreet camera and dressing inconspicuously. This will help you capture candid shots without disrupting the natural flow of the scene.

### 2. **Use Natural Light**: Public transport can be dimly lit, so make use of natural light whenever possible. Position yourself near windows or doors to take advantage of the available light. This will help you capture sharp and well-exposed images without relying on artificial flash.

### 3. **Focus on Details**: Public transport is full of interesting details that can add depth and context to your photos. Pay attention to the expressions, gestures, and interactions of passengers. Look for unique patterns, textures, and reflections that can enhance the visual appeal of your images.

### 4. **Experiment with Angles**: Public transport offers a variety of vantage points for capturing photos. Experiment with different angles, perspectives, and compositions to create visually engaging images. Consider shooting from above, below, or at eye level to add a sense of dynamism to your photos.

### 5. **Be Respectful**: When photographing strangers on public transport, it's important to respect their privacy and personal space. Avoid taking close-up shots without permission and always be mindful of the people around you. If someone expresses discomfort or asks you to stop, it's best to comply and move on.
