# Zoner Photo Studio X Gains AI Masking For Amazing Retouching, Burning & Dodging, And More!

In the world of photography, post-processing plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall quality of images. Whether you're a professional photographer or an amateur enthusiast, having the right tools at your disposal can make a significant difference in the final result. One such tool that has recently gained attention is Zoner Photo Studio X, which has introduced AI masking for amazing retouching, burning & dodging, and more!

## Introduction

Zoner Photo Studio X is a comprehensive photo editing software that offers a wide range of features to help photographers take their images to the next level. With its latest update, the software now includes AI masking technology, which allows users to easily and accurately select and edit specific parts of an image. This feature is particularly useful for retouching portraits, enhancing landscapes, and creating artistic effects.

## AI Masking for Amazing Retouching

One of the most exciting aspects of AI masking in Zoner Photo Studio X is its ability to automatically detect and select objects in an image. This makes it much easier for users to isolate specific areas for retouching, without having to spend hours manually creating complex selections. The AI masking tool also includes advanced algorithms that can accurately distinguish between different elements in a scene, such as hair, skin, and background, ensuring precise and realistic edits.

With AI masking, photographers can quickly and easily remove imperfections, smooth skin, enhance colors, and make other adjustments to improve the overall quality of their images.

## Burning & Dodging

In addition to AI masking, Zoner Photo Studio X also offers burning and dodging tools, which are essential for adding depth and dimension to images. Burning allows photographers to darken specific areas of an image, while dodging lightens those areas, helping to create a more balanced and visually appealing composition.

By using burning and dodging techniques, photographers can draw attention to certain elements in a scene, highlight textures and details, and create a sense of drama or mood. These tools are particularly useful for landscape photography, where subtle adjustments can make a significant difference in the overall impact of an image.

## Practical Tips

When using AI masking in Zoner Photo Studio X, it's important to start with a high-quality image that is well-exposed and in focus. This will make it easier for the software to accurately detect and select objects in the scene. Additionally, it's helpful to use a stylus or graphics tablet for more precise edits, especially when working on intricate details such as hair or fine textures.

When burning and dodging, it's important to use a light touch and make subtle adjustments to avoid over-processing the image. Experiment with different brush sizes and opacity levels to achieve the desired effect, and don't be afraid to try different techniques to see what works best for your specific image.

## Conclusion

With the introduction of AI masking, burning & dodging, and other advanced features, Zoner Photo Studio X has solidified its position as a powerful and versatile tool for photographers of all skill levels. Whether you're retouching portraits, enhancing landscapes, or creating artistic effects, this software offers a wide range of tools to help you achieve your creative vision. By incorporating these new features into your workflow and experimenting with different techniques, you can elevate your photography to new heights and create stunning images that truly stand out.
