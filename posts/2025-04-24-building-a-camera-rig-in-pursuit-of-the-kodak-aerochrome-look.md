# Building a Camera Rig in Pursuit of the Kodak Aerochrome Look

In the world of photography, there are certain looks and styles that stand out and capture the imagination of photographers and viewers alike. One such look is the vibrant and surreal aesthetic of Kodak Aerochrome film. Known for its unique color palette that turns greens into pinks and reds, this film has become highly sought after by photographers looking to create bold and striking images.

While the Kodak Aerochrome film has been discontinued, photographers can still recreate its distinctive look using digital cameras and specialized camera rigs. In this blog post, we will explore how you can build a camera rig to achieve the Kodak Aerochrome look and take your photography to the next level.

## Introduction to Kodak Aerochrome

Kodak Aerochrome was a color infrared film originally developed for military reconnaissance purposes. However, photographers soon discovered its artistic potential and began using it to create stunning and otherworldly images. The film produces vibrant pink and red hues in place of the usual greens, resulting in surreal landscapes and portraits that are truly one-of-a-kind.

Unfortunately, Kodak discontinued the Aerochrome film in 2009, leaving photographers scrambling to find ways to replicate its unique look. This is where building a camera rig comes into play.

## Practical Tips for Building a Camera Rig

### 1. Modify Your Camera

To achieve the Kodak Aerochrome look, you will need to modify your digital camera to capture infrared light. This can be done by removing the infrared-blocking filter that is typically present in digital cameras. While this process can be complex and may void your camera's warranty, it is essential for capturing the unique colors of the Aerochrome film.

### 2. Use an Infrared Filter

In addition to modifying your camera, you will also need to use an infrared filter to block out visible light and only allow infrared light to pass through. This will help you achieve the signature pink and red hues of the Kodak Aerochrome look. There are various types of infrared filters available on the market, so be sure to choose one that is compatible with your modified camera.

### 3. Experiment with Different Settings

Achieving the Kodak Aerochrome look is all about experimentation. Play around with different camera settings, such as exposure, white balance, and ISO, to find the perfect combination that produces the vibrant colors and surreal effects you desire. Don't be afraid to push the boundaries and try new techniques to create unique and eye-catching images.

### 4. Post-Processing

Once you have captured your images, you can further enhance the Kodak Aerochrome look through post-processing. Use editing software like Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom to adjust colors, contrast, and saturation to bring out the vivid pinks and reds that are characteristic of the Aerochrome film. Experiment with different filters and effects to create a truly unique and stunning final image.
