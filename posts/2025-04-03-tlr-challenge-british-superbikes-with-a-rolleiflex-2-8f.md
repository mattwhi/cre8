# TLR Challenge – British Superbikes with a Rolleiflex 2.8f

Are you a photographer looking for a unique challenge to test your skills? Look no further than capturing British Superbikes with a classic Rolleiflex 2.8f. This twin-lens reflex (TLR) camera offers a different shooting experience compared to modern digital cameras, but it can produce stunning, timeless images that stand out from the crowd. In this blog post, we will explore how you can take on this challenge and come out with some amazing shots.

## Practical Tips

1. **Get to Know Your Camera**: Before heading to the racetrack, spend some time familiarizing yourself with your Rolleiflex 2.8f. Understand how to focus using the waist-level viewfinder and adjust settings such as aperture and shutter speed.

2. **Choose the Right Film**: Selecting the right film is crucial when shooting with a Rolleiflex. Opt for a high-speed film to capture fast-moving subjects such as British Superbikes. Consider using black and white film for a classic look or color film for vibrant images.

3. **Experiment with Composition**: The square format of the Rolleiflex can lead to unique compositions. Try different angles and perspectives to create visually interesting shots. Don't be afraid to break the rules and experiment with framing.

4. **Capture the Action**: British Superbikes races are fast-paced events with plenty of action. Anticipate the movement of the bikes and riders to capture dynamic shots. Use a fast shutter speed to freeze the action and avoid motion blur.
