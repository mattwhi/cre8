# Try These Tips From Lindsay Adler To Take Dramatic Portraits of Men

When it comes to photographing men, creating dramatic and impactful portraits can sometimes be a challenge. Renowned portrait photographer Lindsay Adler has shared some valuable tips that can help you capture striking images of male subjects. Whether you're shooting portraits for a client or for personal projects, these tips can elevate your photography game and help you create memorable images.

## Practical Tips

### 1. Play with Lighting

Lighting is crucial in creating dramatic portraits, especially when photographing men. Experiment with different lighting setups such as Rembrandt lighting or split lighting to add depth and dimension to your images. Using harsh light can also create bold shadows and highlights, adding a sense of drama to your portraits.

### 2. Focus on Expression

Encourage your male subjects to convey emotion and personality through their expressions. Whether it's a subtle smirk or a serious gaze, capturing authentic emotions can make your portraits more compelling. Work with your model to evoke the desired mood and expression for the shoot.

### 3. Experiment with Angles and Composition

Playing with angles and composition can help you create visually interesting portraits. Try shooting from different perspectives, such as shooting from below to add a sense of power and dominance to your images. Incorporating leading lines or framing techniques can also enhance the overall composition of your portraits.

### 4. Use Props and Wardrobe

Incorporating props and wardrobe choices can add an extra layer of storytelling to your portraits. Encourage your male subjects to bring items that reflect their personality or interests, which can help create a more personalized and meaningful portrait.
