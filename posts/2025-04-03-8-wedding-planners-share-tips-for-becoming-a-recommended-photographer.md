Are you a photographer looking to break into the wedding industry? One of the best ways to get your foot in the door is by establishing relationships with wedding planners. Wedding planners are often the ones recommending photographers to their clients, so building a good rapport with them can lead to a steady stream of referrals. To help you get started, we asked 8 wedding planners to share their top tips for becoming a recommended photographer.

## Practical Tips

1. **Be Professional**: Show up on time, dress appropriately, and communicate effectively with the wedding planner. A good first impression goes a long way.

2. **Showcase Your Work**: Create a portfolio that highlights your best work and showcases your style. Wedding planners want to see examples of your photography before recommending you to their clients.

3. **Offer Competitive Pricing**: Be upfront about your pricing and make sure it is competitive with other photographers in the area. Wedding planners are always looking for ways to save their clients money.

4. **Be Flexible**: Wedding planners appreciate photographers who are willing to be flexible and accommodate last-minute changes. Show that you are easy to work with and can adapt to different situations.

5. **Stay in Touch**: Keep in touch with wedding planners even after the wedding is over. Send them updates on your latest work and stay on their radar for future referrals.

6. **Network**: Attend industry events, join wedding planner associations, and connect with wedding planners on social media. Building relationships with wedding planners outside of work can lead to more recommendations.

7. **Ask for Feedback**: After working with a wedding planner, ask for feedback on how you can improve. Constructive criticism can help you grow as a photographer and make you more appealing to future clients.

8. **Deliver Quality Work**: Above all, make sure you deliver quality work that exceeds expectations. Wedding planners want to recommend photographers who will capture their clients' special day beautifully.
