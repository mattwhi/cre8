# Canon Announces New RF Telephoto, But You Can’t Get It in the US Just Yet

Canon recently announced the release of their new RF telephoto lens, the RF 400mm f/2.8L IS USM and the RF 600mm f/4L IS USM. These lenses are highly anticipated by photographers who are looking to capture stunning images from a distance. However, there is a catch - these lenses are not yet available in the US market. 

## Introduction

The new RF telephoto lenses from Canon are designed to provide photographers with the ultimate in image quality and performance. With fast apertures of f/2.8 and f/4, these lenses are perfect for shooting wildlife, sports, and other distant subjects with stunning clarity and detail. The built-in image stabilization also makes it easier to capture sharp images, even in low light conditions.

While these lenses have generated a lot of excitement among photographers, there is disappointment for those in the US who are eagerly waiting to get their hands on them.

3. **Explore Alternatives:** In the meantime, consider renting a telephoto lens or exploring other options for capturing long-distance shots. There are many rental companies that offer a wide range of lenses for photographers to try out.
