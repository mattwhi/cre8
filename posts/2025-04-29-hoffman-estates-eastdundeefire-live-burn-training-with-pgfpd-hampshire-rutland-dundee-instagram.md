# Hoffman Estates / @eastdundeefire Live Burn Training with @pgfpd Hampshire Rutland Dundee - Instagram

Are you a photographer looking to capture the intensity and drama of live burn training exercises? Look no further than the recent collaboration between Hoffman Estates Fire Department, East Dundee Fire Protection District, Hampshire Fire Protection District, Rutland-Dundee Fire Protection District, and the Palatine Rural Fire Protection District. This joint training session provided photographers with a unique opportunity to document firefighters in action, honing their skills in a controlled environment.

## Introduction

Live burn training exercises are essential for firefighters to practice their skills in realistic scenarios. These exercises involve setting controlled fires in specially designed structures to simulate real-life emergencies. Photographers can capture the intensity and teamwork involved in these training sessions, creating powerful images that showcase the dedication and bravery of firefighters.

## Practical Tips for Photographers

1. **Safety First**: Before attending a live burn training session, make sure to familiarize yourself with the safety protocols and guidelines. Wear appropriate protective gear, stay a safe distance from the fires, and follow the instructions of the training officers.

2. **Capture the Action**: Look for dynamic moments to capture, such as firefighters entering a burning building, battling flames, or rescuing simulated victims. Use a fast shutter speed to freeze the action and create sharp images.

3. **Focus on Emotions**: Firefighters often display a range of emotions during live burn training, including determination, focus, and teamwork. Try to capture these emotions in your photos to convey the intensity of the training exercises.

4. **Experiment with Angles**: Don't be afraid to get creative with your composition. Try shooting from different angles, such as low to the ground or from above, to add visual interest to your images.

5. **Use Natural Light**: If possible, try to shoot during the golden hours of sunrise or sunset to take advantage of the soft, warm light. Natural light can add a beautiful, cinematic quality to your photos.
