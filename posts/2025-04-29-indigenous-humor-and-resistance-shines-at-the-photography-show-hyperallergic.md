# Indigenous Humor and Resistance Shines at The Photography Show - Hyperallergic

The Photography Show at Hyperallergic is an annual event that showcases the work of talented photographers from around the world. This year, one of the standout themes was Indigenous humor and resistance, as photographers used their art to challenge stereotypes and celebrate their cultural heritage. In this blog post, we will explore some of the most powerful and thought-provoking images from the show, and discuss how Indigenous photographers are using humor as a form of resistance.

## Introduction

Indigenous photographers have long been using their art as a tool for resistance, challenging dominant narratives and reclaiming their own stories. At The Photography Show, these photographers brought their unique perspectives to the forefront, using humor to subvert expectations and challenge stereotypes. By using their art to celebrate their cultural heritage and challenge the status quo, Indigenous photographers are reclaiming their own narratives and pushing back against colonialism.

One of the most striking images at the show was a photograph by [Jolene Yazzie](https://www.joleneyazzie.com/), a Navajo photographer who uses humor to challenge stereotypes about Indigenous peoples. In the photograph, a group of Navajo elders can be seen wearing traditional regalia while holding smartphones and taking selfies. The image is a powerful commentary on the intersection of tradition and modernity, and challenges the idea that Indigenous peoples are stuck in the past.

## Practical Tips for Photographers

As a photographer, there are a few practical tips you can take away from the Indigenous humor and resistance showcased at The Photography Show. First and foremost, it's important to consider the power dynamics at play when photographing marginalized communities. Instead of perpetuating stereotypes, try to capture the complexity and diversity of Indigenous cultures.

Another important tip is to listen to the voices of Indigenous photographers themselves. By supporting their work and amplifying their voices, you can help to challenge dominant narratives and create space for Indigenous perspectives in the art world. Finally, don't be afraid to use humor in your own work. Humor can be a powerful tool for resistance, allowing you to challenge stereotypes and subvert expectations in creative and engaging ways.

## Conclusion

The Photography Show at Hyperallergic was a powerful reminder of the importance of Indigenous voices in the art world. Through humor and resistance, Indigenous photographers are challenging stereotypes, reclaiming their own narratives, and celebrating their cultural heritage. As a photographer, it's important to listen to these voices, support their work, and use your own art as a tool for resistance. By doing so, you can help to create a more inclusive and diverse art world that celebrates the rich tapestry of Indigenous cultures.

In conclusion, Indigenous humor and resistance shine brightly at The Photography Show, reminding us of the power of art to challenge dominant narratives and celebrate cultural heritage. As photographers, we can learn from the work of Indigenous artists and use our own art as a tool for resistance and social change. Let's continue to amplify Indigenous voices and create a more inclusive and diverse art world for all.
