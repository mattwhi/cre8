3. **Explore different angles**: Don't be afraid to get low to the ground or climb to higher vantage points to capture unique perspectives of the rivers and their surroundings.
4. **Capture the details**: Pay attention to the small details, such as rocks in the water or ripples on the surface, to add interest and depth to your photos.
5. **Visit at different times of day**: The quality of light can have a big impact on your photos, so try visiting the rivers at different times of day to capture varying moods and atmospheres.
