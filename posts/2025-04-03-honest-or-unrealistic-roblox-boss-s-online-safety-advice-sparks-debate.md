# Honest or unrealistic? Roblox boss's online safety advice sparks debate

As photographers, we know the importance of online safety. With the rise of social media platforms and online communities, it's crucial to protect our work and personal information. Recently, the CEO of Roblox, Dave Baszucki, shared some advice on online safety that has sparked a debate among internet users. Some believe his advice is honest and practical, while others argue that it's unrealistic and unattainable. In this blog post, we'll explore the different perspectives on Baszucki's online safety advice and provide some practical tips for photographers to stay safe online.

## Introduction to Roblox CEO's online safety advice

In a recent interview, Dave Baszucki, the CEO of Roblox, shared his thoughts on online safety. He emphasized the importance of using strong, unique passwords for each online account and being cautious about sharing personal information online. Baszucki also recommended enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts and regularly updating privacy settings to ensure maximum security.

While Baszucki's advice may seem like common sense to some, others have criticized it as being unrealistic. Many internet users argue that it's nearly impossible to remember unique passwords for every account and that enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts can be time-consuming and inconvenient.

## Practical tips for photographers to stay safe online

Despite the debate surrounding Baszucki's online safety advice, there are some practical steps that photographers can take to protect themselves online. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe while sharing your work online:

1. **Use a password manager:** Instead of trying to remember dozens of unique passwords, consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords for all your accounts. This will help you stay organized and ensure that your accounts are protected.

2. **Enable two-factor authentication:** While it may seem like a hassle, enabling two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts. Most websites and apps now offer this feature, so be sure to take advantage of it to keep your accounts safe from hackers.

3. **Be cautious about sharing personal information:** When posting your work online, be mindful of the personal information you're sharing. Avoid including sensitive details like your home address or phone number in your posts, and be wary of requests for personal information from unknown sources.

4. **Regularly update privacy settings:** Take the time to review and update the privacy settings on your social media accounts and websites. Limit who can see your posts and photos, and be selective about the information you share with others online.

By following these practical tips, photographers can protect themselves and their work online while still maintaining a strong presence in the digital world.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, online safety is a crucial aspect of being a photographer in today's digital age. While the debate over Dave Baszucki's online safety advice continues, it's important for photographers to take proactive steps to protect themselves online. By using a password manager, enabling two-factor authentication, being cautious about sharing personal information, and regularly updating privacy settings, photographers can minimize their risk of falling victim to online threats. Remember, staying safe online doesn't have to be difficult or unrealistic â€“ it just requires a bit of diligence and awareness.
